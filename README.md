Weather forecasting is essential to timely and effective agricultural planning in a nation like India, where a sizable section of the populace works in agriculture. For farmers to make wise judgements, they need up-to-date, accurate information on meteorological parameters including temperature, pressure, humidity, and rainfall. Farmers in isolated locations, however, frequently do not have instant access to this kind of information and must instead rely on delayed sources like television, radio, and newspapers. By creating a real-time weather monitoring system that continuously measures important environmental indicators and sends the data to farmers via Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) technology, our project tackles that difficulty. Farmers can take preventative action to safeguard their crops and improve farming methods by getting timely information. Irrigation is another crucial component of agriculture, and because of labour-intensive and ineffective methods, it currently accounts for 40% of water waste. The labour and time load is further increased by the requirement that farmers physically visit their fields in order to manage irrigation systems. In order to address this, the project incorporates an automatic irrigation system that automatically regulates the water pump based on the moisture content of the soil using soil moisture sensors. The approach, according to experimental data, keeps soil moisture within the epitome range of 0.52 to 0.55, as opposed to the 0.46 to 0.59 that is fluctuated by conventional methods. Additionally, automation resulted in a significant reduction in water consumption, with savings of almost 23.2% compared to human control every irrigation cycle. This technology reduces the need for human intervention and labour while simultaneously conserving water.
By integrating automatic irrigation with real-time meteorological updates, this research makes a substantial contribution to sustainable agriculture. It promotes improved resource management, crop protection, and yield optimisation by providing farmers, particularly those in remote locations, with timely and useful information. This strategy supports the objectives of smart farming and opens the door for low-cost, scalable agricultural advances in underdeveloped nations.
